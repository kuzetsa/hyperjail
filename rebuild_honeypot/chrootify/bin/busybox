# this isn't actually a copy of busybox, you need to build it.

# use musl, glibc, or whatever you want.

# the configurator tool for busybox itself is easy.

# it gives you the option for static linked, etc.

# and now for the readme to output something:

echo 'stat busybox'

# more stuff I guess

echo 'file busybox'

# this isn't a precompiled busybox.

# (please provide your own)
